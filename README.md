# ServerKit
ServerKit is not an Apple product, it is a Discord bot especifically to combat bot features that are locked by paywall and servers that have a lot of bots (and some of them, to the server owner, only use one of the functions).

## Setup

1. Install latest version of Python, discord.py, PyNaCl, Youtube-dl, python-dotenv, FFmpeg and discord-py-slash-command.
2. Create a .env file with the contents:

"PRODUCTION=False

PRODUCTIONTOKEN=(Leave blank)

DEVTOKEN=(Your bot token)"

3. Start main.py

## Features
### Open Source (and being Libre)
Being open source benefits the users, everyone can submit bugs, check code, or even pull request to make the bot work better. I believe in trust!
### Free, forever
No patreon bs.

## Support
Join the Support server on [Discord](https://discord.gg/CqRkKpZR), or if the bug impacts all users, submit a issue here.

## Roadmap
- More fun features (View memes and create memes)
- Welcomer features
- More moderation features (Logging, etc.)

## Contributing
I am ABSOLUTELY open to any contributions, please make sure you state what changed.

## License
Up until version 0.3.5.1, it is in [GPL license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html), after 0.3.5.1, it will be switched to [AGPL License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html) since Discord Bots counts as server software (duh.)
